We are the Incredibots (FTC #26336), a rookie FTC team from Sammamish, WA. Our team ranges from 7th-9th graders at various schools in the area. Last year, we did FLL for the first time as team 60626, and after an incredibly successful season, decided to switch to FTC for a challenge. We are a community-based team.
